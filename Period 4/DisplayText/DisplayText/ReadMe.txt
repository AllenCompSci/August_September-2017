Remember while coding, to save often Ctrl + S saves the single file, 
Ctrl + Shift + S saves all files in the project. Also each time you debug or 
compile saves the project. Remember that when you Debug or Compile sometimes 
you are unable to go back and undo previous edits. Make sure you keep up with 
your changes.
